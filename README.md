# Album-App
This is a React-based web application for managing albums. It allows users to fetch albums from an API, add new albums, update existing albums, and delete albums. The project demonstrates the use of React hooks, asynchronous data fetching, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
